# Fix the Harness Before Anything Runs

**Rule:** The workflow graph, the roots, the gates, and the stop condition get written in code before the first agent starts.

**Why:** You cannot debug a roulette wheel by nudging it. The harness is what makes two runs comparable, and it is the only part of the system you fully control.

**In practice:**
- The lead orchestrator gets three things: a goal, how well it is done, and when to stop.
- The graph is code; the agents are interchangeable parts.
- A harness you rewrite after every incident was never a harness.

**Kem:** *"It begins with a harness, a workflow graph designed before anything runs. The roots and the gates are fixed in the code."* — 5 Agents Writing the Same File [00:12]
