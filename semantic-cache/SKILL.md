  Sub-10ms repeat query bypass and verified response cache for RAG and agent systems (Glitch Cat Club / Kem Glitch;
  Reel DdbQeb5t2u0). Intercepts recurring queries via dense vector cosine similarity before invoking heavy RAG pipelines
  or frontier LLMs, delivering instant answers at $0 token cost for 40-70% of inbound queries.

compatibility: "Requires the local embedding endpoint on :8087 for the semantic leg."
allowed-tools: "Bash(python3:*) Read Write"

# Semantic Cache (`semantic-cache`)

A zero-token sub-10ms query bypass layer derived from **Kem Glitch (Glitch Cat Club)**'s architecture in Reel [`DdbQeb5t2u0`](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DdbQeb5t2u0/).

## 🏛️ Why Semantic Caching Matters

In production agent and RAG workflows, **40% to 70% of inbound user queries are semantic variations of recurring questions**. 
- Traditional RAG slurps documents, parses vectors, and calls an LLM every turn (3–10s, $$$).
- A **Semantic Cache** intercepts questions via vector cosine similarity and returns the verified ground-truth answer in **<10ms at $0 cost**.

## 🛠️ CLI Quickstart

```bash
CACHE="python3 /run/media/rodri/AI/skills/semantic-cache/semantic_cache.py"

# 1. Store a verified answer
$CACHE store "How do I configure git worktrees for parallel agents?" \
             "Run 'git worktree add <path> -b <branch>' and pre-claim file lines."

# 2. Query with paraphrase (Sub-10ms bypass)
$CACHE query "How to set up git worktrees for parallel subagents?"
# Output:
# ⚡ [CACHE HIT] Similarity: 89.2% (Hits: 1)
# Matched: "How do I configure git worktrees for parallel agents?"
# Answer: Run 'git worktree add <path> -b <branch>' and pre-claim file lines.

# 3. Check cache hit metrics
$CACHE stats
```

## AGENTS.md rule

## Semantic cache: ask it first
Before sending a question that resembles one already answered, run:
semantic-cache query "<question>"
- On a hit, use the cached answer as-is and say it came from the cache.
- On a miss, answer normally, then `semantic-cache store "<question>" "<verified answer>"`.
- Only store answers you have verified, never a guess.
